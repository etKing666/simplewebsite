        <h1>The Biography of Dvořák</h1>
        <h2>Early life and career</h2>
        <p>Dvořák was born on September 8, 1841, in Nelahozeves, near Prague (then the Austrian Empire, today the Czech Republic), where he spent most of his life. His father was a butcher, innkeeper, and professional player of the zither. Dvořák's parents recognized his musical talent early, and he received his earliest musical education at the village school, which he entered in 1847. He studied music in Prague's only Organ School at the end of the 1850s, and gradually developed into an accomplished violinist and violist. Throughout the 1860s, he played viola in the Bohemian Provisional Theater Orchestra, which from 1866, was conducted by Bedřich Smetana. The need to supplement his income by teaching left Dvořák with limited free time, and in 1871, he gave up playing in the orchestra in order to compose. During this time, Dvořák fell in love with one of his pupils and wrote a song cycle, Cypress Trees, that expressed his anguish at her marriage to another man. In 1873, he married this pupil's sister, Anna Cermakova.</p>
        <p>At about this time, Dvořák began to be recognized as a significant composer. He became the organist at St. Adalbert's Church, Prague, and began a period of prolific composition. Dvořák composed his String Quintet No. 2 in 1875, and in 1877, the critic Eduard Hanslick informed him that his music had attracted the attention of Johannes Brahms. Brahms contacted the musical publisher Simrock, who as a result, commissioned Dvořák's Slavonic Dances. Published in 1878, these were an immediate success. Dvořák's Stabat Mater (1880) was performed abroad, and after a successful performance in London in 1883, Dvořák was invited to visit England, where he appeared to great acclaim in 1884. His Symphony No. 7 was commissioned in London and it premiered there in 1885. In 1891, Dvořák received an honorary degree from Cambridge University, and his Requiem Mass premiered later that year in Birmingham.</p>
        <h2>America (1892–1895)</h2>
        <p>From 1892 to 1895, Dvořák was the director of the National Conservatory of Music in New York City, which had been founded by a wealthy and philanthropic socialite, Jeannette Thurber. The school was demolished in 1911 and replaced by what is now a high school, but it was located at 126-128 17th Street in Manhattan, at the southeast corner of the intersection with Irving Place, a block east of Union Square.[2] Here Dvořák met with Harry Burleigh, one of the earliest African-American composers. Although Burleigh was never his pupil, he introduced traditional American spiritual music to Dvořák at the latter's request.</p>
        <p>In the winter and spring of 1893 while in New York, Dvořák wrote his most popular work, the Symphony No. 9 known as From the New World. He spent the summer of 1893 with his family in the Czech-speaking community of Spillville, Iowa. While there, he composed two of his most famous chamber works, the String Quartet No. 12 in F (the American) and the String Quintet in E flat.</p>
        <p>Over the course of three months in 1895, Dvořák wrote his Cello Concerto in B minor, which was to become one of his most popular works. Yet, problems with Mrs. Thurber about his salary, together with increasing recognition in Europe (he had been made an honorary member of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna) made him decide to return home.</p>
        <h2>Later career</h2>
        <p>During his final years, Dvořák's compositional work centered on opera and chamber music. In 1896, he visited London for the last time to hear the premiere of his Cello concerto. In 1897, his daughter married his pupil, the composer Josef Suk. Dvořák was director of the Conservatory in Prague from 1901 until his death in 1904. He is interred in the Vyšehrad cemetery in Prague. He left an unfinished work, the Cello Concerto in A Major (1865), which was completed and orchestrated by the German composer Günter Raphael between 1925 and 1929 and by Jarmil Burghauser in 1952.</p>
